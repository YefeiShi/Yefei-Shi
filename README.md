> ### “We believe the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet, we’ll be able to feel present – like we’re right there with people no matter how far apart we actually are” .  
#### -From Zuckerberg in the latest intro video where the company's name changed from Facebook to Meta.

## During the class, we mentioned open source and carried out cooperative house painting.  Open source is an important feature of Metaverse, so I here is a briefly introduction of Metaverse.

## The metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets.

### - Ethereum

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, once said about the "meta universe": As far as I know, people use it to refer to the Internet + hyper-immersive virtual reality, or Internet + shared state (so things can move between platforms ). In the latter case, Ethereum will become an amazing core part.

### - Minecraft
Why does "Minecraft" have some features that can be called "meta universe"? There are many reasons for this. First of all, in "Minecraft", anyone can create their own world. After you create a world, you can invite anyone on your local WIFI to join. In "Minecraft", what you create is a world in your heart, not a world that is designated and designed. Every world is unique. When you create a world in "My World", then you become the creator of this world. You can carry out open activities, establish your own property rights system, and set the rules of the world. In other words, "Minecraft" tends to be decentralized, rather than building a honeypot system that encloses everyone in a small world. "Minecraft" follows a decentralized mindset.

### - Roblox
Roblox is a multiplayer online game creation platform. Players have a high degree of freedom when creating games. The platform has a comprehensive economic system that is interoperable with the real economy. Virtual assets and virtual identities can communicate between game content, and creators can design business models in their games.

### - Second life
"Second life" is different from ordinary traditional games. It is not a game in the ordinary sense. People can socialize, shop, build, and do business in it. Players pay great attention to creation. Individuals can create houses, pets, cars, clothes, games, programs, and so on. All items created by players have property rights, and they can be sold, transferred or leased at will to earn Linden (game currency). A mechanism similar to a linked exchange rate between Linden and the U.S. dollar can be easily exchanged in both directions. This gave birth to various industries in reality, such as shopping malls, advertisers, real estate developers, and even banks. At the peak of "Second life", well-known companies such as Toyota, GM, Adidas, Unilever, etc. all expanded their business territories in the game, and the total output value of the game exceeded the wealth of several third world countries. It even created real-world millionaires.

### The concept of the metaverse's route dispute has been entangled, the core reason being that it has two realization routes and directions. One is internet, the other is blockchain. The Internet school distinguishes between the Internet giants (including software and hardware) that form a monopoly, who want to define the metacosm in terms of product experience, hardware access, world setting, and the blockchain school, which wants to define the metacosm in terms of values, economic principles, and mathematical trust.    
#
### Traditional Internet users also questioned Zuckerberg's attempt to further bind users to his social cage, and that the metacosm was nothing more than an upgraded "nipple" that would leave everyone without the world he designed. Meta inherited its advantages in the Internet, but also bear the original sin of the traditional Internet, the traditional Internet on the data privacy of many violations, so that people have long lost trust in it, users will inevitably question, when you upgrade to the "meta-universe", my exploitation will not be intensified?    
#
### And there is still a big gap between the lives of our general public and the technology needed for the metacosm, and companies that study the metaverse need to improve it in every way, and meta's release gives us a glimpse of the future.

### What is the future like?   
#
### Will the metaverse go in the wrong direction?  
#
### Will the metaverse trigger the next explosive change?  
#
### The future hasn't come yet.   
#
### The future is on the way.
